An experimental Open Source re-implementation of [OeScript](https://github.com/navicore/OeScript/wiki/About) using Scala and  large-scale data processing software.

OeScript is server software with a tuplespace [coordination language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_(coordination_language)) supporting "read", "write", "take", leases, and transactions, and with the additional feature of "attachments".

Notes about the library and tool dependencies and the architecture desicions are posted as [issues][decisions-blog].

Documentation is on the [OeScript Wiki][oescript-wiki].
